a simple maze solver that i dont want to write the docs for but here are the config -

put output img name in main.py  
put maze file name in main.py  
put algorithmm in main.py  

## algorithms -

1. DFS - depth first search
2. BFS - breath first search
3. GBFS - greddy best first search
4. ASTAR - idk full form but its the best
5. RNG - just for run its makes random decisions

## maze format

\# = walls
